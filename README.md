> ðŸ¤– Smart contracts for [Primeâ€™s First Liquidity Mining Program](https://medium.com/primedao/primes-first-liquidity-mining-program-b8e4abb6c63)

In order to bootstrap liquidity for the PRIME token, PrimeDAO will initiate a liquidity mining program â€” alternatively known as yield farming â€” for a Balancer pool. 

`StakingRewards.sol` contract is a fork of a [StakingRewards contract](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/blob/develop/contracts/StakingRewards.sol) by [Synthetix](https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix) with few adjustments made by PrimeDAO team.
